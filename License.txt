In this exploration I would like to rebound a shot from one of my team member @Aryo Pamungkas . Based on the quick poll, many designers choose the night version. So now I'm here designed the landing page using the night version illustration, it's a guide site that has many information and features that useful for adventure especially hiking. Let me know what you think. I also included the PSD file here as freebies for you all, kindly download them here : https://www.dropbox.com/sh/4rv0geoexn7063m/AADyblylFHgcClgWtnR48qF1a?dl=0
